# Movies Statistics - An Interactive Dashboard:

spent on it, Genre of the movie, directors, actors and etc. Analyzing
these factors helps filmmakers to decide on which things they need to
invest their talent, time, and money.

# **Data set:**

The data set contains a list of IMDB top 50 rated movies and details of
those movies like the director of the movie, budget of the movie, gross
earnings, profit, genre, year in which the movie was released run time
and etc.

Different fields of the data:

-   Budget_in_Million: Overall Budget spent on a movie in millions.

-   Profit_in_Mil: Total profit of made by the movie in millions.

# **Purpose:**

A web based interactive dashboard was created to visualize the data
related to the top 20 movies among the 50 movies that we have in our
data set using R shiny.

Our data set contains a list of IMDB top 50 rated movies and details of
those movies like the director of the movie, budget of the movie, gross
earnings, profit, genre, year in which the movie was released run time
and etc. A web based interactive dashboard was created to visualize this
data using R shiny

This interactive visual dashboard helps in analyzing the trend of top 20
movies from the 50 that we have collected, which are being liked by wide
range and verity of people. This dashboard also helps in finding out the
insights which made the films this popular so that investors and
directors can focus on them while making a movie. Viewers can also
interact with the dash board to find out more things about the movies
they liked and can use them to search similar kind of movies to watch,
if they like a top movie they can find out its genre and the director
who directed it and can search for some similar films which have these
things in common.

This dashboard visualizes the movie data using plots like bar-charts,
pie-charts, Tables, and scatter-plots these plots and tables will be
interactive and they also have filtering options such that you can only
look at what you want.

# **Problems addressed and related previous studies :**

This Dashboard helps in comparing *top 20* movies across different
categories like ratings, Gross Earnings, Number of votes, Genre and etc
all together in one place which will give some useful insights to the
users.

*"Over the past twenty years, people have seen considerable growth in
film industry. There are two common measurements for movie quality,
financial metric of net profit and reception metric in the form of
ratings assigned by moviegoers on websites."[1].*

Our dashboard helps in comparing different aspects of a movie based on
its budget, votes, ratings, directors, and the genre .Comparative and
predictive analysis helps in finding associations and relation between
different variables which is an impact full thing to do in analyzing the
future performance of anything like a business or film making or in
health industry.

*"Leveraging historical data from the movie industry, this study built a
predictive model for movie success, deviating from past studies by
predicting profit (as opposed to revenue) at early stages of production
(as opposed to just prior to release) to increase investor certainty."
[2]*

Estimating the factors that are leading to the success of a movie is an
important aspect to analyse for an investors. Investing huge amount on a
movie is often considered risky as there are several factors like Genre,
Actors and Directors involved in the success of a movie, analyzing or
going through these factors helps in predicting the success of a movie
which benefits the investors.

*"However, from an investor’s standpoint, one would want to be as
assured as possible that his/her investment will ultimately lead to
returns or profits."[2]*

Budget is an important aspect that majorly contributes to the profits
that can be made by a movie our dashboard shows there is a positive
correlation between the budget spent on a movie and the profits earned
by the movie.

*"Two variable the budget and release date are in a significant positive
correlation with box office revenue, the other ten determinants found to
be insignificant."[3]*
